    <p>
      Uniform Resource Locators were defined in RFC 1738 in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of
      the World Wide Web, and the URI working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force
      (IETF),[7] as an outcome of collaboration started at the IETF Living Documents birds of a
      feather session in 1992.[8][9]

    <p>
      The format combines the pre-existing system of domain names (created in 1985) with file path
      syntax, where slashes are used to separate directory and filenames. Conventions already
      existed where server names could be prefixed to complete file paths, preceded by a double
      slash (//).[10]
    </p>
    <p>
      Berners-Lee later expressed regret at the use of dots to separate the parts of the domain name
      within URIs, wishing he had used slashes throughout,[10] and also said that, given the colon
      following the first component of a URI, the two slashes before the domain name were
      unnecessary.[11]
